# Name My Church

A tongue-in-cheek church name generator. [https://namemy.church/](https://namemy.church/)

The project is nothing more than a simple static site. The names are generated using a regular grammar with randomly-chosen, weighted production rules. The full vocabulary can be found in vocab.csv, which is best edited in your spreadsheet program of choice.

## Building

Requires `node` and `yarn`. Run `yarn build` to build the site, and `yarn watch` to see changes in real time.
